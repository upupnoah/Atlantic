## Description of the work

As maritime trade developed and changed, the concept of insurance began to penetrate beyond the realm of marine insurance, and in the 14th century, the beginnings of life insurance for death, sickness, and pensions began to appear. by the end of the 15th century, merchants specializing in insurance, such as the Mutual Insurance Organizations (MIOs) specializing in marine insurance, appeared, and from the 17th to the 19th centuries, a large number of insurance companies appeared in the countries of Europe.
